### Apology ###

This is a giant pile of spaghetti chaos nightmares. Some things are optimized, other things aren't. I'm not
a professional, but I will attempt to balance ease of programming and user speed. Somewhere between Dwarf Fortress
at 400 population and a supercomputer running Rogue is what I'm aiming for.

### What is this game? ###

This game is a sad attempt at a finished Roguelike. I tend to start projects and never finish them, so
I am going to do whatever it takes to make a finished game, no matter how minimal. The point of this isn't
beauty - it's completion.
